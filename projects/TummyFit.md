<hr>
To address the issue of poor dietary habits and the double burden of malnutrition, we propose developing an app called "TummyFit." This app aims to improve health outcomes by offering personalized meal plans, a healthy meal database, and a grocery list generator. Users can easily select meals based on their preferences and dietary needs, while the app assists with scheduling, recipes, and grocery shopping. By providing a convenient and personalized tool, TummyFit aims to promote healthy eating habits, prevent chronic diseases, and make meal planning hassle-free.

## Features
